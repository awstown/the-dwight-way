title: BMW 228i
---

I kicked some serious ass last weekend. I've been wanting to buy a car for a while now and I've settled on a BMW 228i. It is an expensive automobile and the most I've ever
spent on a car. Also, I get to pick it up in Germany!! How cool is that. It's
something that I have been wanting for a good while now... finally decided
to make it happen!
