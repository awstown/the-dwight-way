Cover_Letter

I've been a user of github since my junior year of college. I first joined because I was trying to join a quantum computing programming research program. 

I'm applying to this position because I'm looking for a change from current resposibilities. I have been in IT system administration for two years and I've gained a lot of technical expirience. But my favorite part of my current job is when I get to consult on a problem someone is having or when I get to teach someone something new, especially when it makes their lives a little easier. 

Connecting with a team and helping other team members connect is really important to me. 

I believe GitHub fits well my desire to foster good collaboration and this position would allow me to share the joy of using GitHub.

After working in IT for 2 years now. Beacuse the organization I've expirienced a lot of barriers to "getting stuff done". The barriers are oraganization, technical or personal. Theses barriers get in the way of good stuff happening. 



Ultimately, I want to make a difference in people's lives personally and professionally. In my personal life, that means connecting with people, building relationships to better understand them, and volunteering for causes I believe in. In my professional life, that means doing whatever I can to make my client's life a little easier, fostering great collaboration with my colleagues, and building useful tools that are fun to use.

I have the soft skills and technical background to translate the client's needs into technical solutions. My well-rounded skill set enables me to view problems from multiple angles to find the most suitable solution. The idea of helping figure out how to integrate GitHub Enterprise into an organization, especially if it creates or furthers an awesome collaborative environment, is very appealing.  

Finally, I work in an organization that has a lot of barriers to productivity, be it organizational, technical, or personal. After 2 years of navigating these, I'm inspired to look for opportunities that put me in the position to help break walls down and facilitate cooperation in an organization.

I believe this position at GitHub would be a fantastic place to start accomplishing these goals.
