It's been quite some time since my last post, over a year actually. I have not been very serious 
about keeping this website up. I'm not sure.. what this is and what it's not. I don't have any 
specific theme for this blog (for lack of a better word), but recently I was challenged by someone
to authenticity. Initially, I was actually insulted by her words. We were talking about the concept of
a "chamelon" in terms of myself among my different friend sets. In other words, I was telling her about 
my tendancy to fill the missing space within group dynamics. Consquently, one might say I act differently
aroung different groups as oppossed to being the same no matter what. I justified my behaviour by 
saying I'm a private person and prefer to share only certain aspects of myself with others. It then makes 
me uncomfortable when "worlds collide". I feel outed when someone knows something that I've kept from 
anonther group. 

My friend argued that it takes less energy when you're the same with everyone.... I'm not sure I buy it.
Boundaries are awesome, but perhaps that might just be an excuse ;-)
